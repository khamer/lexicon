While the term Label can be used semantically more ways, for development, we use labels just to indicate labels for UI elements like inputs, buttons, or groups of UI elements. If you're just trying to caption, title, or provide a heading for a section, use one of those terms instead. As a rule of thumb, if the content is for accessibility and labelling what something does, it's a label.
