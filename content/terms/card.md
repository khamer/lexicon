Cards are groups of elements that may contain titles, content, actions, and more. Typically the actions they contain are shown as links or buttons within the card, although for UX purposes clicking anywhere on the card may trigger the primary action.

Tiles are closely related to cards, but differ in that tiles are typically a unified element with at most a single action associated with clicking anywhere on them. Tiles also tend to be less distinct from their surroundings and never shown alone.
