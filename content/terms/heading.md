Headings are short bits of text that title pages, sections, articles, cards, and more. They are one of the most common elements within Headers. For semantic purposes, Headings should use one of the HTML heading tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6.)

Subheadings are closely related to headings, but we define them slightly differently. For development, subheadings should only come right after headings. That's different than the typical definition, which would consider headings within subsections subheadings.
