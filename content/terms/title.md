Titles are the names for sites, pages, articles, or sections. They're typically used for the title tag for a page and shown at the start of the related content. While very similar to Headlines, Titles act as the name for the related content whereas Headlines act as more of a hook or lead-in. For example, the Title for a page might be "Our Services", but the Headline is "Custom solutions for your distinct challenges."

Titles are usually displayed as a heading at the start of the related content. Sometimes when content doesn't have a Headline, the Title is shown in the same style as Headlines on other pages of the site.

Subtitles are closely related to to titles and subheadings. For development, subtitles should only come right after titles.
