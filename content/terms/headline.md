Headlines are short bits of emphasized text that caption or start sites, pages, or articles. While very similar to Titles, Headlines typically act more as a hook for the related content whereas Titles act as the name for the content. For example, the Title for a page might be "Our Services" - but the Headline is "Custom solutions for your distinct challenges."

The headline is usually displayed as a heading, but emphasized further by placing it within a Hero or or at an even larger font size.
