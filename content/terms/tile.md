Tiles are groups of elements such as titles, images, and captions that are unified visually into a single element. Typically tiles have at most a single action and its clear that clicking anywhere on the tile triggers that action.

Cards are closely related to tiles, but differ in that cards typically are less unified, may contain multiple buttons or other actions, and are typically more distinguished from their surroundings. Tiles are also never shown alone, whereas cards sometimes are.
